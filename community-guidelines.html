While some skills remain as hobbies. Either way, we believe that there are people out there who have a need for these skills. We are building a community of folks like you and me, who have skills and who need skills. What could be better than to get work done from known people or give services to folks we are connected to.">

<h1>Our mission is to empower everyone to bring to life their skills and your neighbourhood.</h1>
<p>At The Local Tribe we are driven by our mission to connect and enable opportunities for you. We want each one of you with skills to have a storefront, belong to a neighbourhood and bring to life your dreams.</p>
<p>The Local Tribe is a happy place for everyone to thrive. The conversations in the app reflect the diversity of the global communities. Hence, we want you to feel safe when using The Local Tribe.
Before we give you a set of ground rules, here's what we commit to you. We expect the same commitments from everyone working with us, including our company associates, agencies, vendors and suppliers:</p>
<ul><li>We will be transparent in every engagement.</li>
<li>We will protect our users' privacy in compliance with applicable privacy policies, IT security policies, and laws, rules, and regulations.</li>
<li>We will respect copyrights, trademarks, rights of publicity, and other third-party rights.</li>
<li>We will keep you safe. We will remove content, disable accounts and work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of harm or direct threat to anyone or the public safety. </li></ul>
<p>So now this one's for you, lovely people:</p>
<h1>Be your wonderful self</h1>

<p>To be treated like a real person, you must be, and appear as the real person that you are! People will respect you more, engage & book with you more often, and treat you like a real person if you use your actual identity here. Have the courage to be you — instead of "Bot8021″. While not mandatory, we think you'll have a much better experience at The Local Tribe  when you stand behind your actual storefront. Also stay away from using not use mature, profane, or racist images in the profile name and image as well as in your storefront imagery</p>
<h1>Discover more wonderful people like yourself</h1>
<p>your friends and the people in your neighbourhood
Get connected! Discover people within your network of friends, their network and beyond. Find people around you based on your skills, passions and interests. Open a storefront and pursue that things you care about in your neighbourhood. Be the way who you are and surround yourself with people that you trust and can guide you directly where you live.</p>

<p>What makes this great network of skilled individuals work? Your community work, a place to thrive and a joyful place to be in.</p> 
<h1>Own your storefront</h1>
<p>Only create storefronts of skills and products that you alone are able to deliver. If you don't run it or can't fulfill it, don't do it. Nor let any third-party manage your account. Our mission is to empower you so that you reap the benefits of it and not someone else.</p>

<h1>Be honest</h1>
<p>We value above anything transparency, honesty, and truth. Don't misrepresent yourself or lie about who you really are, what skills you have and what you could do with those skills. The Local Tribe is brought together on the contributions of real people who put their reputations on the line. Be one of them. </p>
<h1>Be civil </h1>
<p>Please, don't try to be naughty. We're cheerleaders for many skills unless you are creating storefronts that involve illegal activities. We will report anything on the lines of sensitive content and illegal activities to legal authorities. The simple thumb rule is that if you have doubts about any content that you are sharing or posting, it probably is illegal!   </p>
<h1>Be courteous</p>
<p>We want you to have (good, clean) fun as long as you don't hurt other people. Your right to do so - have good and clean fun while using The Local Tribe - ends where the rights of others to do so begin! The Local Tribe is no place for hateful slurs or harassment. Please, don't share  any words or images that come at the expense of others. Be sensitive to other users around you, and, in general, don't post sexual or violent material. Those things kill conversations, just like in real life. We don't tolerate them and we will remove them immediately.</p>
<p>We support vigorous chatting about neighbourhood issues and bookings. However, we won't tolerate abusive behavior directed at private individuals. Think about that when responding to others, and ask yourself the question: Would you say it to their face?</p>
<h1>Spread the joy</h1>
<p>Make the tribe a richer place by sharing your experiences and in giving reviews. This is the substance of The Local Tribe. It's how you help to grow the community. The Local Tribe is about building personal and professional relationships. Don't spoil that by posting fake reviews that would destroy the trust we're building in our community.</p>
<h1>No ego boosting!</h1>
<p>This is a community, not a fish market. It's okay to talk up your products or services, but only if it's relevant to the conversation. If you're here only to boost about yourself on every chat without doing much else, you and your store are most likely to be removed by our team.</p>
<h1>Respect privacy</h1>
<p>Make sure you have the right to publish any images you post on The Local Tribe, and don't violate the privacy of others.</p>
<h1>Know how to count</h1>
<p>Don't create multiple accounts to violate our guidelines, the app system, or to harass and deceive other users. Don't troll. If you're not sure whether you're a troll, read up on it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29">here</a>. Don't be goofy and spam either in any neighbourhood or chat.</p>
<h1>Guidelines for chatting with skilled users, consumers or in neighbourhood groups</h1>
<p>The Local Tribe allows users to chat and interact with one-another. Don't use this feature indiscriminately to send unsolicited messages to other users.</p>
<ul><li>When contacting skilled users, only send serious booking inquiries.</li>
<li>Personalize the messages you send and don't send boilerplate messages or advertisements. When messaging a skilled user, use his or her name or storefront name, provide a brief description of what you're looking for, and include any details that might help the skilled user to make you an offer.</li>
<li>Make sure the skilled user you're contacting is a good fit for it (always check reviews or the connections through your friends) as indicated by their skills on their storefront. Also please look at a user's storefront before messaging them, which declares the type skills they can deliver  - and make sure your message conforms with their stated preferences.</li>
<li>Don't ask consumers, neighbours or skilled users for random chat invitations if you don't have a serious interest in their skills.</li>
<li>Don't ask for free services or professional advice, or to be hired by the skilled user you're messaging.</li>
<li>Only use group chats for what they are meant for - an exchange about your neighbourhood. They are no place for unwelcome advertisement, harassment or abusive content.</li>
<li>The app allows you to close a conversation once the job is done! While it is not mandatory, once your engagement with another user, skilled or otherwise, is over, do close the conversation. It will ensure that you do not get unsolicited messages.</li>
<li>Understand that if you fail to follow these guidelines, it may result in account suspension or removal.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is something you would like to be broadcasted or shared with the wider community, something that you believe might be of importance and significance to them, please get in touch with us. We will help you do that.</p>
<h1>No phishing or fraud</h1>
<p>Don't use The Local Tribe to engage in phishing or fraud, we mean it!</p>
<h1>Don't get around, don't stick around</h1>
<p>If The Local Tribe isn't for you, there's always the door. We'll miss you, but we'd hate for you to stick around if you're unhappy.</p>
<h1>Need help?<h1>
<p>If you find yourself in a situation, which you are not able to handle or you feel uncomfortable with, our team is always there to help you. Let us know how we can help by writing to <a href="mailTo:hello@thelocaltribe.com">hello@thelocaltribe.com</a>.</p>
<h1>Talk to us</h1>
<p>The Local Tribe is slowly taking off and we're growing every day. We strive to welcome people from around the globe to an environment free from abuse. To do this, we rely on wonderful people like you. If you see something that you believe violates our community guidelines, <a id="report" href="javascript:;">please report it to us</a>. Our team reviews everything you report to help make sure The Local Tribe is safe.</p>
<p>As with everything here at The Local Tribe, even these community rules will become better. If we have missed something here, you have questions or feedback, please do not wait, <a id="write" href="javascript:;">write to us</a> right away! We're open for discussion!
</p>
<h1>If you crossed the line…</h1>
<p>...we may send you an email and ask you to explain what you're up to. We know sometimes context is important. If you don't reply or won't explain yourself or even better fix the problem, then we will suspend or in the worst case remove your account and storefront. Hey, we're fair people, but if things go out of hand we reserve the right to suspend accounts or remove content, without notice, for any reason, particularly to protect our services, app infrastructure, users, or community.</p>

<p>Thank you for following our these rules, that are themselves, carefully crafted. As with any community, The Local Tribe is what you make out of it! We're hoping by sharing your skills, passions and interests, we will grow - as individuals and communities - to be more smarter, and even a little crazy :) Above everything we always stand for honesty!</p>
<p>Vineet & Jayant, Founders of The Local Tribe</p>
